array --> array is an group of elements of same data type, array size need to be fixed

list :
list is an group of elements of different data type, list size is not fixed
2)list is mutable
3)list is ordered [10,2,3,1,344,1] -->[10,2,/...]
4)list allows duplicate values
5)list allows hetrogenous data
6)list stors data in index based

list []

for create blank list will have list = []

tuple: tuple is collection of elements of different data type, 
1) tuple is immutable
2) tuple is ordered
3) tuple allows duplicate values
4) tuple allows hetrogenous data
5) tuple stores data in index based

userName:"pass",
userName:"pass",
userName:"pass",
userName:"pass",
userName:"pass",
userName:"pass",


dictonary :
dictonary is collection of elements of different data type,
1) dictonary is mutable
2) dictonary is unordered
3) dictonary allows duplicate values but not duplicate keys
4) dictonary allows hetrogenous data
5) dictonary stores data in key value pair not in index...


set:
set is collection of elements of different data type,
set is mutable
set does not allow duplicate values
set is unordered
