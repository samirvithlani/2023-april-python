data persistancy:
to achive data persistancy we need to use a database or files..
to store data in form of files or database permanently.

Major we have 3 operations to perform on data
1) open file...
2) write data into file / read data from file
3) close file

modes of opening file:
r - read mode           [file should be exist]
w - write mode        [file will be created if not exist and if exist it will be over written]
a - append mode       [file will be created if not exist and if exist it will be appended]
r+ - read and write mode [file should be exist]
w+ - write and read mode  [file will be created if not exist and if exist it will be over written]
a+ - append and read mode [file will be created if not exist and if exist it will be appended]
x - exclusive mode   [file will be created if not exist and if exist it will throw error]


path:
1) absolute path  C:\Program Files\Java
2) relative path  ./ curren directory
                  ../ parent directory
                  ../../ parent of parent directory
                    ../../../ parent of parent of parent directory  



read() it will read all data ---> [find by word or char or line]
readLine() it will read line by line ---> [1]
readLines() -> read all lines ---> [
readLines return type is list


TASk:

read all data from file line by line using readLine function
